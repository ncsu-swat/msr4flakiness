/**
 * Test EXEC-41 with a disabled PumpStreamHandler to check if we could return
 * immediately after killing the process (no streams implies no blocking
 * stream pumper threads). But you have to be 100% sure that the subprocess
 * is not writing to 'stdout' and 'stderr'.
 *
 * For this test we are using the batch file - under Windows the 'ping'
 * process can't be killed (not supported by Win32) and will happily
 * run the given time (e.g. 10 seconds) even hwen the batch file is already
 * killed.
 *
 * @throws Exception the test failed
